Please install all the dependencies given in reguirement.txt before executing the jupyter notebook by using the following command in the terminal
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main.ipynb file line by line to execute the entire code. it has markdowns to explains the logic and decision.The code has been modularized as much as possible.

There is a main.html file also present for easier reading of the code

Unit test have been written using the pytest module. currently only written for 2 files
1. load_data
2. generate_features

# ToDo list
1. Create dummy data to properly check the code functionality
2. write out the tests for other modules as well
3. Add arges to run the code via teminal
4. Further next steps and logics are discussed in the main.ipynb notebook
